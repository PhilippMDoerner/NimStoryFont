          The Witch's Hut is a small, dilapidated cabin hidden deep in the heart of the Dark Forest.

          The hut is surrounded by twisted trees and eerie toadstools, and the air is thick with the scent of herbs and incense. 
          Visitors are warned to approach with caution, as Elena is known to be both unpredictable and dangerous.
