Seemingly satisfied with that, Murtagh nods to himself.</p>\n<p>After that I ask for why Barbatos isn't just being released back into the hells to have him everywhere but here. The reason is quite self evident. The lamp manages to contain some of his power, leaving him still with a considerable amount of it. The issue is, that he's too powerful now, due to the dark star. To elaborate on that, he tells a bit of a story. There used to be originally a group of protectors, divine beings called \"angels\". The one chief among them, Lucifer, wanted to influence the universe more than just protecting it. He became the first devil and was given \"the compulsion\", an innate desire to fight chaos. Suleman, after capturing the Djinn and the Trine captured Lucifer and... turned him into a staff. When Lucifer fell from his position as an angel and became a devil, he left behind \"the dark star\", a relic now in Barbatos' possession. So it is not like releasing him back would get him forced under the rule of a more powerful archdevil. He would likely be more powerful than some, if not most of them. And with that power would come the ability to act, potentially in revenge against Suleman. Not necessarily enough to overcome the compulsion, but there are ways to leave the tree intact and still destroy everything Suleman ever created. This may not be true for Agari and Lairann, but they are dogmatically loyal to Barbatos and thus would likely work to free Barbatos if released themselves. And weakening them isn't really a possibility.</p>\n<p>At my loudly contemplating that last bit, Rhi keeps squinting harshly at me, but I just shrug it off.

More specifically, he asks what knowledge that could do something like this would seek from the temple.</p>\n<p>That question, for the first time, is strange enough that not even Suleman has a direct answer to it. Fen goes on to reveal that he is aware somebody tried to make an incarnation of <strong>him</strong> as a concept to get access to his... knowledge ability. He assumes the temple of time is their backup plan, now that this failed. Suleman muses that they are trying this on people that almost achieved godhood as those that are gods likely wouldn't be available through this mechanism.</p>\n<p>At that Caitriona hands him the fire-dagger she took from Fen all those months ago. Suleman looks at it for a couple seconds before noting it to be the flame of a dragon, taken from it and carved with runes to simulate ancestral memory. It effectively reaches back in time to find somebody that best embodies the concept that was ripped from the dragon. As no thing can exist twice at once, this also means that the dragon no longer can breathe fire.</p>\n<p>He assumes that if the dragon were exposed to flame it would bring forth a being most aligned with a dragon's fire, aka primordial flame. Which... explains the dead, chained up, adult/ancient dragon Fen mentioned seeing on his trip through Galway, where he also got the daggers from.</p>\n<p>As for the daggers themselves, he notes that mixing in a humanoid's blood would dilute this effect and the draconic heritage, which conjures forth images of Astaroth almost immediately. That's about the time he notices Bedivere who was trying his best to fade into the background. He points out that this conjuring up made the person suddenly gain draconic ancestroy, but not turn they themselves draconic. Cleansing water effects like those in the bath would remove this.</p>\n<p>Suleman also notes that draconic heritage tends to be able to extract feelings and memories also from blood. So if somebody were to, say, create one of these daggers from a dragon that had a vendetta, and the person transforming the dagger cut themselves with had a similar vendetta, that would have a \"much closer and more profound\" effect... of some sorts. That effect likely being that somebody stronger that embodies the concept better would be summoned.

He proceeds to demonstrate something with a devil plushie on how mirror demons are made from devils mixed with the concept of \"change\".

It has the ability to access the watchers memories, thoughts and the appearance you put into the mirror to perform an action or fill a role it's been given.</p>\n<p>On Murtagh's question why this would be given to Caitriona, Suleman points out that luck is the concept of changing order/fate in your favor, and that this is likely siphoning off Cait's ability to change fates. Which is the shocking revelation of a century right there, truly. What else, other than the fact it came from hags and is made of energy absorbant material and was getting fatter to the point it cracked could possibly hint at that? Truly, nobody could have known. Suleman proceeds to compare this less to Cait being a battery and more her being an orange pressed out on a juicer.</p>\n<p>For some reason Cait then proceeds to, instead of just destroying the mirror, to talk with it, trying to think of ways on freeing it and what it would do if given the choice. Some way too long conversation follows that concludes with Cait deciding to free the mirror demon eventually, convinced it won't come after her as she believes they were both shoved into this situation without their input and thus would want to be friends and meet up later.
