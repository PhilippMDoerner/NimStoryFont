We skipped a bunch of versions to get to the Ivy built, Angular-CLI based latest.
This was a big migration to a new structure and build process, so file a bug if you encounter any issues.

### 13.0.1
Minor cleanup in the project and removed an accidental dependency

## 8.1
Added call to Map.remove in OnDestroy handler.
This should ensure that any outstanding event handlers are cleaned up.
Added demo example for adding/removing maps dynamically. 

## 8.0
Support for Angular.io 10.

## 7.0
Support for Angular.io 9. ðŸŽ‰

- Are your markers broken? In Leaflet 1.6, the marker icons changed enough to create new hashes. See [README](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet/blob/master/README.md#a-note-about-markers) for more details.
- Renamed UMD bundle to `ngx-leaflet.umd.js`. This shouldn't affect anyone unless you're manually including the bundle.
- Angular deprecated parameterless forRoot, so I removed the static function. You may need to update your import.

Fixed an error running the demo.
Cleanup in the README.
Fixing minification to exclude comments and include license.

Added several input bound map options including ```[leafletMaxBounds]```, ```[leafletMaxZoom]```, and ```[leafletMinZoom]```.

## 2.0
Support for Angular 4.
